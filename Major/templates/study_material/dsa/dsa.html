         <h1>Data structures</h1>
         <p>Almost all programs process data in some form. Data needs to be stored in a way that means it can be easily
            manipulated by program code. Very basic (primitive) data types, such as an integer (a whole number) or
            Boolean (True or False), allow you to store a single value. It is possible to combine these primitive data
            types to create compound data types (a record) or to create more complex data structures (arrays and
            lists).<br>
            At a more advanced level, static and dynamic data structures are introduced. Together with abstract data
            types, such as stacks and queues, they allow the more sophisticated organisation and manipulation of data,
            and provide methods for adding, removing, and traversing data.
         </p>
         <h3>How data is stored</h3>
         <p>In computer science, you often need to manage large amounts of data. This data needs to be organised into
            data structures for a computer program to process it.<br>

            You may have organised your files and folders on your computer in a specific structure with files that
            relate to each other in one folder. For example, you may have a folder named 'computer science' and all the
            files you create for computer science are stored inside the folder. You may also have a folder named 'code'
            inside the 'computer science' folder, where you save all of your programs. When you create your simple
            folder structure, you have to think about how files and folders are stored.<br>

            Programmers also need to think about how the data in programs is stored in order to access and manipulate
            the data. You can think of a data structure as a container that stores a collection of data.</p>
         <h3>Arrays</h3>
         <p>An array is a data structure that holds a number of data items or elements of the same data type. When you
            want to store many pieces of data that are related and have the same data type, it is often better to use an
            array instead of many separate variables. An element in an array can be accessed using the the location
            number, known as index. In this array of bird names, Seagull is in index 0, Falcon is in index 1, Eagle is
            in index 2, and Robin in index 3. It is important to point out that in most programming languages, the first
            index in an array is 0, not 1.</p>

         <table>
            <tr>
               <th>Location number</th>
               <th>0</th>
               <th>1</th>
               <th>2</th>
               <th>3</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td>Element</td>
               <td>Seagull</td>
               <td>Falcon</td>
               <td>Eagle</td>
               <td>Robin</td>
            </tr>
         </table>

         <p>Different programming languages implement array type structures in a variety of ways. In some languages, an
            array is implemented as a static data structure. Its length (the number of elements it has) is fixed when
            declared and cannot be changed during runtime. This type of array is often referred to in exam
            questions.<br>

            In other languages, arrays are dynamic. In Python, a list is a data structure that can be indexed like an
            array. However, it is dynamic and can hold different types of data (at the same time) so does not conform to
            the pure definition of an array.</p>

         <h3>Static data</h3>
         <p>When you create a static data structure, the system reserves memory for a set amount of data. This is
            established by the programmer in advance, even though less memory may actually be needed during program
            execution. In many programming languages, an array is usually implemented as a static data structure that is
            fixed in size and can only contain elements of the same data type. The contents of a static array can be
            changed, but the array cannot be resized.</p>
         <p>Static arrays are very efficient in terms of being able to access elements directly, but can be inefficient
            in terms of memory use. Memory is wasted if, for example, the array is declared with space for 100 elements
            but only 10 elements are added when the program is run. On the other hand, if insufficient space has been
            allocated, the program may crash or not work properly.</p>

         <h3>Dynamic data</h3>
         <p>Dynamic data structures are memory efficient. The memory capacity of a dynamic data structure is not fixed,
            and the number of data items that it can hold is constrained only by the overall memory allocation to the
            program.</p>
         <p>In Python, a list is an example of a dynamic data structure. A Python list has the advantage that its size
            is not predetermined, and the elements in the list can be accessed directly.</p>
